    <h2>Article</h2>
    <p>
      On the outskirts of Washington, D.C., in the Montgomery and Prince George‚Äôs Counties of Maryland, there is a 16-mile span of suburban communities, although ‚Äúsuburbs‚Äù does not fully convey the actuality of their urban terrain. Bethesda, Silver Spring, College Park, and New Carrollton are home to crowded communities and extensive workplace hubs. High-rise offices and apartment buildings lead to a very busy, profitable space that sees hundreds of thousands of commuters buzzing back and forth each day. This region of Maryland is also home to the University of Maryland (UMD)‚Äôs flagship campus, consisting of 40,000 students who mostly commute.

      This is why the demand for a new light rail that weaves through the region has been high for decades. The Purple Line is exactly that, and is expected to finish construction in late 2027. Administered by the Maryland Transit Authority, it will have 21 train stops and will directly intersect with stops on the D.C. Metro‚Äôs Orange, Red, and Green Lines without going directly into D.C.. It will also be connected to the New Carrollton Amtrak station, the MARC commuter rail, and local/regional bus networks.
      
      The Purple Line is considered the sole option to maximize the profitability of this densely populated business and residential hub, making The University of Maryland much easier to access, improving access to various resources and reducing the negative impact of car-dependent infrastructure. It is expected to grant metro access to 174,000 Maryland residents and significantly increase employment rates.
      
      ‚ÄúCar dependency is a major economic drain on the region and the people who live here,‚Äù said Stephen Kenny, Legislative Analyst for the Montgomery County Council. ‚ÄúHigh-capacity transit is the only solution to traffic congestion, and will allow the region to keep growing and inclusively welcoming new residents.
      
      ‚ÄúThere is a [lot] of demand for travel between the Maryland suburbs, as evidenced by the heavy traffic along the Beltway, East-West Highway, University Blvd, and other east-west corridors,The Purple Line works to create a more interconnected Metro network‚Äù
      
      During rush hour periods, the region‚Äôs streets are intensely trafficked. Having an infrastructure that is car-dependent is bad for the environment and diminishes quality of life for residents, students and commuters. The Purple Line is expected to reduce the area‚Äôs congestion by 17,000 cars a day, supporting efforts to combat climate change.
      
      However, creating an entirely new light rail is a tall order. When construction started in August 2017, it was meant to be completed in 2022 and cost $2 billion. Now along with the current 5-year delay, it is already $4 billion over budget‚Äìand the price is expected to increase. According to Kenny, the construction of the Line itself has been ‚Äúextremely disruptive to daily life.‚Äù
      
      There have been proposals for new buses that run more frequently in the region. However, this idea was unpopular because it would require a similar amount of labor and disturbance (the current roads would have to be altered significantly), but with a total payoff that‚Äôs thought to be much smaller than a new light rail‚Äôs could be.
      
      The Purple Line is projected to transport 70,000 commuters a day by 2030, less than a new bus system likely could. The possible benefits, however, haven't been considered worth it, given how underway the Purple Line has been.
      
      Additionally, due to this area‚Äôs metropolitan qualities, the preexisting public buses are always clogged and have to compete with thousands of cars.
      
      Despite the Purple Line‚Äôs demand and potential for economic, personal, and environmental benefits, a notable downside arguably outweighs all of that: the construction‚Äôs reinforcement of gentrification, and its impact on local, long-time businesses.
      
      Kalysta Perez, Executive Assistant at the Takoma/Langley Crossroads Development Authority, challenges the idea that the Purple Line is a net positive.
      
      ‚ÄúFrom my job and hearing the complaints of business owners and pedestrians, I would say they are [very] negatively affected,‚Äù Perez said. ‚ÄúBusinesses in the area have been losing money since the start of construction ‚Ä¶ many have had to end their leases.‚Äù She said that 30-year-old businesses closed because Purple Line construction made it difficult for customers to attend their stores to the point of ‚Äúopting out all together.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhile this area's design is more car than pedestrian centered, the problem of pedestrian safety has only worsened,‚Äù she added.
      
      Once the Purple Line is completed, the cost of living in the area is expected to get even higher. According to a UMD study, rent has already risen in apartments located near (currently under construction) Purple Line train stops.
      
      ‚ÄúThe demographics near the construction zones‚Äîmany are BIPOC and immigrant communities,‚Äù Kenny said. ‚ÄúThere might be some disproportionate impacts.‚Äù
      
      Montgomery and Prince George‚Äôs County is hometo majority non-white and low-income populations. Gentrification (due to the area‚Äôs proximity to D.C.) has been an escalating concern to these residents. Slowly, the area is becoming wealthier and less diverse, at the expense of families that have been there for decades. The Purple Line‚Äôs contribution to this could be severe.
      
      ‚ÄúOn one hand, you could say that the people living and working near the stations will see the most benefit by being better connected to work, school, groceries, and entertainment.,‚Äù Kenny said. ‚ÄúBut [there's a risk] of the displacement of current residents as property values rise if there is not enough housing to meet the demand to live next to the Purple Line.‚Äù
      
      Gentrification has proven to have many harmful effects such as displacement of more working class communities. However, the economic benefits of attracting wealthier populations‚Äîas well as creating smoother, more sustainable infrastructure to support workers and students‚Äîis desired by local governments. That‚Äôs why the Purple Line, despite all the delays (primarily due to COVID, changes in contractors and investors, and a lack of prioritization), has not been abandoned. But is it worth it from an ethical perspective? 
      
      ‚ÄúAs of late, they have been closing one major intersection for about 4 weeks at a time (sometimes 3 if they are able to work fast enough),‚Äù Perez said. ‚ÄúI will say they have started picking up the pace. This tells me that this whole thing has been a learning process and a lot of trial and error.‚Äù
      
      ‚ÄúOne thing that comes with more transit is development. It is inevitable that changes to the surrounding housing and businesses happen, but that does not benefit the people who have been around for years,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTherefore, if the communities and businesses will be displaced, I believe that the solutions don't outweigh the downsides, as the people who really need it won't get to experience the solutions.‚Äù
